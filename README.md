# HomeDepotSKUListingApp
### Objective: Design and develop a robust listing app to enhance productivity and accuracy in inventory management at Home Depot stores.
As an employee at Home Depot, I've observed the need for a more efficient way to handle SKUs and create item lists. 
Currently many people manually write them down or print out price stickers. 
By creating a dedicated listing app, we can simplify this workflow and eliminate wasteful overhead 
while empowering employees to more effecintly task and collaborate.
