# HomeDepotSKUListingApp
### Objective: Design and develop a robust listing app to enhance productivity and accuracy in inventory management at Home Depot stores.
As an employee at Home Depot, I've observed the need for a more efficient way to handle SKUs and create item lists. The current manual process of writing down SKUs is time-consuming and prone to errors. By creating a dedicated listing app, we can simplify this workflow and empower employees to scan SKUs directly into a digital list.
